```

# IMPORTANT
```
# 1. As it was hard to emulate some sounds like diabolic voices or forks and kives; some of these were recorded 
by us and then put them in SuperCollider
# 2. The guitar sound is the only sound out of supercollider recorded with a real instrument, 
for it, we use AmpKit on iOS
# 3. Those records are in the guitar-recorded-sounds folder in this repository
```
